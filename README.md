Multi-Level Related Model Administration
========================================

Multi-Level Related Model Administration for Django enables three levels of 
related Model objects to be edited on a single admin page.

If you have models like the following this tool can help you:

```python
from django.db import models

class A(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)


class B(models.Model):
    a = models.ForeignKey(A)


class C(models.Model):
    b = models.ForeignKey(B)


class D(models.Model):
    b = models.ForeignKey(B)

```


Usage
=====

In your `admin.py` file (or elsewhere if you organize your code more rigorously) 
you would need something like the following:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.forms.models import modelformset_factory
from mlrma.forms import MlrmaModelForm
from mlrma.models import MlrmaStackedInline

import models

CFormSet = modelformset_factory(models.C, extra=2, can_delete=True, exclude('b',))


class BForm(MlrmaModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = model.B

    formset_classes = [CFormSet]


class BStackedInline(MlrmaStackedInline):
    model = model.B
    extra = 1
    form = BForm

class AAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    inlines = [BStackedInline]

admin.site.register(models.A, AAdmin)
```



Notices
=======

Currently code only spot checked to work with Model classes A, B, and C from 
the example above. Theoretically, Model D could also be use (in the same way as 
C) but it has not been tested.

I could use some help creating some unit tests and extending this solution to 
allow for more than 3 levels of relationships.
